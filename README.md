# HTB Documentations

This repository contains documentation and walkthroughs of various labs completed on **Hack The Box (HTB) Academy**.  
The goal is to **learn and understand at least one box per day**, improving my practical knowledge of cybersecurity and penetration testing.

I am a beginner in cybersecurity, still building my foundational skills, and this repository reflects my learning journey. Most of the boxes documented here are **retired beginner-class labs** available for practice on HTB.

- Notes on tools, techniques, and concepts learned
